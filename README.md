# Car-Insurance-Smart-Contract
Proof of concept for a decentralized car insurance model

# General Project Setup
Easiest way to start with all tools is via a Linux based system or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
1. Install node.js, Python3, ganache CLI
2. Setup a account on Infura (ETH Testnet API Service)
3. Setup Metamask with some accounts and fund them with Test ETH

Add a .env file to all projects:
 - Set the env variable for WEBÂ§_INFURA_PROJECT_ID with the ID provided in your prepared Infura account
 - Set the different PRIVATE_KEY env variables with those of your metamask accounts. Those are used to deploy the contract and to interact with them
